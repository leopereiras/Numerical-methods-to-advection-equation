# Numerical Methods for Differential Equations II

## UERJ 2023.2 - Professor Grazione Souza.

- Advection-Diffusion Equation
- Comparison of Methods applied to the Advection Equation
- Forward Time-Backward Space (FTBS)
- Lax-Friedrichs
- Lax-Wendroff
- Beam-Warmimg

> The objective is to use the finite volume method to solve the advection-diffusion equation.

## How to use

> Modify the desired parameter in the "novaEntradaDados" file and run the "main" file.

> Comment on the methods you will not run. (If you run more than one method at the same time, it will result in an error)
